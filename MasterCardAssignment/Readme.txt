Coding Exercise Instructions:
 

As a follow-up, we would like you to participate in the following coding exercise.

 

Assignment:
Create a C# solution that builds a master list of smartphone orders from three data files, and then prints it to a console as described below.

 

Input:
Input data are attached. Each file contains first line as the header and then smartphone order information per line. The properties are separated by either a space, comma, or a pipe. You may assume that there are no separators in any of the properties themselves.

 

Output:
When the program is executed using the provided input data files, it should produce output that matches the file “output.txt”.

 

The merged smartphone orders list should be printed as follows:

By order date descending.
By top grossing smartphones models descending.
By year ascending then by price descending (using a custom sort implementation).
 

Submission:
Please send your solution to the original email within 48 hours from the email receipt. You can either email both compiled binaries and source files in a zip folder or host your final work on websites such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
